// Firstpos and lastpos of a regular expression

For leaf nodes:
    firstpos: Contains the position of the leaf node.
    lastpos: Contains the position of the leaf node.
For the * (Kleene star) operator:
    firstpos: Same as the firstpos of the subexpression.
    lastpos: Same as the lastpos of the subexpression.
For the . (concatenation) operator:
    firstpos: Same as the firstpos of the left subexpression, unless the left subexpression is nullable, in which case it includes the firstpos of both subexpressions.
    lastpos: Same as the lastpos of the right subexpression, unless the right subexpression is nullable, in which case it includes the lastpos of both subexpressions.
For the | (union) operator:
    firstpos: Includes the firstpos of both subexpressions.
    lastpos: Includes the lastpos of both subexpressions.   

// nullable

Union (|): 
    The union of two regular expressions is nullable if either of the expressions is nullable. For example, if A and B are regular expressions, and A is nullable 
    (A can match an empty string) or B is nullable, then A | B is nullable.

Kleene Star (*): 
    The Kleene star operator allows zero or more repetitions of the preceding expression. It is always nullable since it can match an empty string. For example, 
    if A is a regular expression, then A* is nullable.

Grouping ( ): 
    Grouping does not affect the nullability itself, but it can influence the nullability of the expressions inside the group. If the expressions inside the group 
    are nullable, then the group as a whole can be nullable.

// followpos

Concatenation (.): 
    The followpos of a concatenation is the followpos of the right subexpression. For example, if A and B are regular expressions, then the followpos of A.B is 
    the followpos of B.
    for i in self.left.lastpos:
        self.followpos[i] += self.right.firstpos

Kleene Star (*):
    The followpos of a Kleene star is the followpos of the expression inside the Kleene star. For example, if A is a regular expression, then the followpos of A* 
    is the followpos of A.
    for i in self.lastpos:
        self.followpos[i] += self.firstpos
